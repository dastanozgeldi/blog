My name is **Dastan (he/him)** and this is the place you can view my art :)<br/>
I've got a number of different projects you may like, and that's probably why you are here.

Currently, I'm learning web development using Flask on the back.

As a demo of what I am able to do, take a look at [Qysqa](https://github.com/dastanozgeldi/qysqa)!
